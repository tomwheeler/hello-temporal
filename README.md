# hello-temporal
This repository will contain a basic "Hello World" sample for each
supported SDK, intended for new users during the onboarding process.

All of them will support environment-based configuration for the
Temporal Service address, Namespace, and authentication details. This
enables one to run the example with a self-hosted Temporal Service
(local or remote) or Temporal Cloud without having to modify the code.

## Examples

 * Go
 * Java
 * .NET (C#)
 * PHP
 * [Python](python/README.md)
 * Ruby
 * TypeScript
